Author:  ScoJo
Created: Jul 18, 2001
Requires Proxomitron Naoko4 beta 5+

Description:

  Lowers the brightness of bright backgrounds in the body tag, tables, table
  cells and any other tags with a bgcolor attribute.  Works with both HTML
  and CSS.

Note:

  The dimming filters won't affect named colors unless they are converted
  to their hex equivalents.  This is what the color name list does with the
  help of the "Color Name to Hex Converter" filters.
