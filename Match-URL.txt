# Item Matched:  URLs (with or without a protocol) - NoAddURL

# Last Modified: Dec  4, 2001
# Syntax:        $LST(Match_URL)
# Lists Used:    URL_Schemes Match_Hostname Match_IP_Address Top_Level_Domains Match_URL_SAP
# Variables:     \9 is the protocol (will be detected if there was none).
#                \@ is the URL with tags removed, &nbsp; changed to %20, etc.
#
# Description:
#
#    This is an include-style list for matching a URL.  This version
#    matches more than just URLs including hostnames and IP addresses,
#    but due to the leading wildcards, it chews the CPU if placed at
#    the start of a filter.
#
# Notes:
#
#    There might be problems where the whole URL isn't grabbed.  The replacement
#    stack (\#) collects bits of the URL path as the tags are taken out.  However,
#    there's a limit to the number of times stuff can be pushed onto the stack.
#    Bottom line: The URL could be cut-off if there is too much stuff to take out.
