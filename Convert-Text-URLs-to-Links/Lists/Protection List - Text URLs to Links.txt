# Description
#
#   This is a list of stuff with URLs that shouldn't be matched by filters
#   that convert text URLs to links.  (Thanks to Scott for pointing out
#   this technique a while ago.  It works for now, but I wish there was a
#   better solution.)  It took a lot of trial and error to come up with
#   this list of protected stuff and it still isn't 100%.
